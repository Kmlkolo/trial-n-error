## exercises
Playing around with functions, practicing topics from courses, e.g.:
 - create variables of 3 different types of interfaces in Go and show how they work;
 - create a map that can store an array containing different types;
 - scan input, do something with it, check for an error, log it.

Practice is the right way to understand and become proficient, no? :-)
